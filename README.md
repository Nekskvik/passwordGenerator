# PASSWORD GENERATOR

Hi everyone !!! I've been immersing myself more and more into JavaScript for a while now. 
I really started enjoying it technologies, buiding different kinds of projects including more or less JS.

At the first place I did not get alone with JS. I don't know the reason why. oh no, I guess I know ! When I first started learning JS, it was not a daunting task whatsoever. Apparently I thought it wasn't. Started learning Js a decided to take a quick path by chellanging. I thought a couple of weeks would be enought to become jaded, but that was not the case. As I was watching more and more tutorials, it did not seem like hard work. I was picking everything up pretty fast. Did not feel like I was missing something. But later on, it turned down to be a huge issue. I could not write a sigle line of code without glancing at referenes. It was soooo frastrating. So, I burnt out. I did not touch js for a long while. A couple of months later I came back and started all over again. I did not harry up this time (there are reasons for it: 1)I'm a freshman, so, had to pay attention to my degree; 2)Started to learn PHP). At this point of me development path, I pretty satisfied with where I'm and what I've pick up for my technologies.

From this moment, I'm going to upload more and more work.

**P.S** Do not forget to try out this password generator. It works great, and, to me is goig to be a "every day tool" in case I need a strong password)

Thank You for Your Attention !
